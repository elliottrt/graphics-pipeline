9/19 - filled triangles

z buffer - float[]

add list of triangles to scene, add Render() method that renders all of them
	I don't know if we actually want this?
	maybe a subclass of Scene - MultiMeshScene
	probably use linked list? #include <list>


RenderTriangleMesh(mesh) {
	for tri in mesh {
		DrawTriangle(tri.v0, tri.c0, tri.v1, tri.c1, tri.v2, tri.c2)
	}
}

DrawTriangle(v0, c0, v1, c1, v2, c2) {

}

triangle:
	3 indices into vertex array
