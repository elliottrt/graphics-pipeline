	capturing the environment and using that to render the rest of the scene
	we saw this earlier where point lights pre-render the scene to detect shadow
		we would use cube maps for this - a cube where each face is a PPCamera

	can specify a ray from a point with only pan and tilt

	how represent?
		one way is cube map - a cube where each face is a PPCamera & FrameBuffer

		define 90* by 90* camera with 90deg fov

		start
		pan 90
		pan 90
		pan 90
		reset
		tilt 90
		reset
		tilt -90

	reflections
		one way to do it for flat surfaces
			imagine the object in the reflection is actually behind the reflector
			aim at where the line between the camera and the imagined object intersects the reflector
		what about curved surfaces?
			there is no closed form solution to find where it reflects to...
			we use a cube map at the center of the reflector
