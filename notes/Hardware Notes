	separate chip - gpu
	executes a lot of small programs in parallel
		can process pixels/vertices in parallel
	cpus have 1-8 cores, gpus have 1000s
		faster because more cores, not because better algorithms

	we want to start using graphics hardware - OpenGL/DX/Metal?
	why APIs?
		abstraction, separation - portability (especially for opengl)
		macos doesn't like opengl :(

	TODO:
		on clear: set clear color, clear depth|color
		convert ppc to opengl - see Lectures/HWrendering.pdf
